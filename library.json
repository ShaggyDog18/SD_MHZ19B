  "description": "MH-Z19B NDIR infrared gas module is a common type, small size sensor, using non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) principle to detect the existence of CO2 in the air, with good selectivity, non-oxygen dependent and long life. Built-in temperature compensation; and it has UART output and PWM output.  This compact library features access to all module features though an abstracted class and methods to manage the module implemented in user-level functionality. The library does not work with PWM module signal. Communicates with the module by Hardware or Software UART.",
